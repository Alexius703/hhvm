(** When querying a decl, we have 3 possible states. *)
type 'a t =
  | DoesNotExist
      (** The decleration does not exist in the current repo state.
          This sould result in a symbol not found error. *)
  | NotYetAvailable
      (** We can't find it in the abstraction/layer that should be
          providing access to symbols in the current repo, but that
          doesn't necessarily mean it doesn't exist at all in the repo.
          The type checker should continue type checking but should avoid
          expensive behavior like backtracking as a subsequent type check
          is likely to be invoked with more informaiton available.
          Avoid expensive operations like backtracking. *)
